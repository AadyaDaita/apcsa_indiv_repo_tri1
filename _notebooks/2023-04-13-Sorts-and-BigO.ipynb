In this case, the number of swaps is equal to the sum of the first n-1 positive integers, which is (n-1)(n-2)/2. Therefore, the total number of comparisons and swaps is (n-1)(n-2)/2, which is O(n^2).\n",

    "In the best-case scenario, when the list is already sorted, the time complexity of Bubble sort is O(n). However, in practice, it is unlikely to encounter a completely sorted list, so the worst-case scenario is a more realistic representation of its performance."
