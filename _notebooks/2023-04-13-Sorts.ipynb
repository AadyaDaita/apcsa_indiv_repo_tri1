In this case, the number of swaps is equal to the sum of the first n-1 positive integers, which is (n-1)(n-2)/2.

    "In the best-case scenario, when the list is already sorted, the time complexity of Bubble sort is O(n). However, in practice, it is unlikely to encounter a completely sorted list, so the worst-case scenario is a more realistic representation of its performance."

    "### Hashmaps\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash maps are data structures that store data in key-value pairs. They allow for fast retrieval of data based on a given key. In a hash map, the key is run through a hash function that converts it into an index within an array. The value associated with that key is then stored in the array at the corresponding index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of hash functions allows for constant-time access to the value associated with a given key, making hash maps very efficient for data retrieval. Hash maps are widely used in computer science and programming for tasks such as caching, database indexing, and implementing associative arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using a binary search tree to sort through the values. Then , once we find the value, then we associate the value. Caluclate the time, and return it. "
