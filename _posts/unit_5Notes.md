**Void method**

Methods define the behaviors for all objects of a class and consist of a set of instructions for executing the behavior. Void methods don't return anything. Example:

<img src="images/notes9"/>


**Void method with parameters**
These are methods that take in some parameter, or input but doesn’t return anything

Overloading: Having multiple methods with the same name, but different parameters. 

<img src="images/notes10"/>


**Non-Void methods**

The value that is returned from a method, you need to specify the type that is being returned in the method signature. Let’s say you return something to main, main now has access to that returned value. Remember, return does not mean print. You would need to specifically say print the return value if you want it to be displayed.
