title: Primitive and Wrapper Classes Data Types
---

**Java**
- When you write code in java. 
- Then, there are two parts to the compiler: the first part turns the code into bytecode. 
- Then, the second part makes the code suitable for any type of processor/computer. 

**Data Types**
- Primitives: built in data types, and do not need to declare a class to use them
- Wrapper classes are non-primitive data types: you do need to declare data types
    - For college board, String is a primitive data type
    - In regular Java, Strings are Non-primitive data type.
    - Wrapper classes are capitalized, and primitives are not.  
- Wrapper classes have method, since you are declaring them 
- python is a weak programming language, since we don't have to specifically declare data types. 
- However, java is a strong data type, since we have to specifically declare data types.
